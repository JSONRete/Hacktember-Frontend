# Learnability Pathways - Frontend

Visually impaired users, 50 years or older, who are looking to learn Python coding language need a product/platform that is accessible and allows them to easily learn in a way that carefully considers how they receive information. Our goal is to create a product tailored to their needs by using a combination of visual, voice and audio aids along with an artificial intelligence feature to enable them to learn seamlessly and comfortably. 


## Introduction

Learnability Pathway is an educational platform that combines a _Flask_ API backend with a _React_ frontend. Its primary goal is to empower users with the opportunity to learn Python using free resources sourced from the _YouTube_ API. To enhance accessibility, we harness the capabilities of the _OpenAI_ API and _Elevenlabs_ API."
