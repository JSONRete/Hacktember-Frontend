# Learnability Pathways - Frontend

Visually impaired users, 50 years or older, who are looking to learn Python coding language need a product/platform that is accessible and allows them to easily learn in a way that carefully considers how they receive information. Our goal is to create a product tailored to their needs by using a combination of visual, voice and audio aids along with an artificial intelligence feature to enable them to learn seamlessly and comfortably. 


## Introduction

Learnability Pathway is an educational platform that combines a Flask API backend with a React frontend. Its primary goal is to empower users with the opportunity to learn Python using free resources sourced from the YouTube API. To enhance accessibility, we harness the capabilities of the OpenAI API and Elevenlabs API."
